# recursive_autoencoders


Need to do:
* Make recursive autoencoder variational


No Batch norm
Shared Batch norm
Non-shared Batch norm

Non-Variational
Variational

Stacked
Recursive


Things that already work:
* Stacked
* Recursive
* Shared batch norm recursive
* Shared batch norm stacked
* Stacked Variational

Easy
* Non-shared batch norm recursive
* Non-shared batch norm stacked
* Testing suite

Medium
* Recursive Variational
* Inception Score

Get data on:
* Stacked
* Stacked with non-shared batch norm

Data
* Parameter usage
* Train time
* Reconstruction error
* (Inception score eventually)

Namimg Schema:
* V - variational
* SB - Shared Batch Norm, NB - Normal Batch Norm
* S - Stacked, R - Recursive
* \# - layers
* \# - coding size
